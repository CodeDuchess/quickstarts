  prerequisites:
    - The system operating system must be RHEL8 or RHEL9
    - The administrator must have sudo access on the system
    - The system must have the Insights client package installed, and be registered to Insights for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

    Install and register the malware service
  introduction: |-
    Here you will install YARA and Insights client. YARA is an open-source and multi-platform tool that detects code similarities between predefined malware signatures and a scanned RHEL 
    system. If one or more conditions in a predefined signature exist on a scanned RHEL system, YARA records a malware hit on that system. 
    Install the YARA Package on each host you want to scan for Malware and Ensure the Systemâ€™s Operating System versions are either RHEL 8 or RHEL 9.  
   
  tasks:
    - title: Install and register
      description: |-        
        1. Install YARA: 
        ```
        sudo dnf install yara
        ````
        2. Install the Insights-client RPM:
        ```
        sudo dnf install insights-client
        ```
        3. Test the Insights-client connection:
        ```
        sudo insights-client --test-connection
        ```
        4. Register the system with Insights for Red Hat Enterprise Linux:
        ```
        sudo insights-client --register
        ```
        After everything is successfully installed and registered, you are now ready to run the client malware detection collector.

    - title: Initial run of the malware detection collector
      description: |-

       1. Run the Insights client malware detection collector 
       ```
       sudo insights-client --collector malware-detection
       ```

       The initial run creates a malware detection configuration file in 
       `/etc/insights-client/malware-detection-config.yml`, performs a test scan, 
       and uploads the results.

       2. Make scans live on Insights
       vi `/etc/insights-client/malware-detection-config.yml` 
        
        2. Perform a full filesystem scan.
        Edit `/etc/insights-client/malware-detection-config.yml` 
        
          a. Set the test scan option from true to false 
             test_scan: false
          b. Minimize scan time by setting any of the following options: 
             `Filesystem_scan_only`
             `Filesystem_scan_exclude`
             `Filesystem_scan_since`

          c. Re-run the client malware detection collector
          ```
          sudo insights-client --collector malware-detection
          ```

      - title: Optional Scan of processes.
        description: |- 
        This will scan the filesystem followed by a scan of all processes.

        1. Edit `/etc/insights-client/malware-detection-config.yml`
           a. Set the test scan processes from false to true
           ```
           scan_processes: true
           ```

           b. Save the changes.

        2. Run the malware detection collector again      
           ```
           sudo insights-client --collector malware-detection
           ```
           
      - title: Review YARA matches in the Insights dashboard
        description: |- 
        In this next task, you will navigate through Insights to the Malware service to view the matched signatures results. 

         1. Navigate to Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.
         2. Navigate to **Insights for RHEL**.
         3. Click **Security** in the left navigation panel. 
         4. Select Malware in the dropdown.
         5. You can click on **Systems** or **Signatures** to see different views.
